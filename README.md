******** ABOUT ********

Your actions define you


So who are you really?

An interactive verse submission website designed by Fern (@fern_shy).

******** MISSION ********

All of the instrumentals featured on this website were created in collaboration with Lush Soma (@lushsoma) (much thanks for your input and vision) 
with the intent of them being a part of a 10 track album.

The purpose of this website is to have a single location where users can not only submit their verses in order to be considered for the album
but also preview the beats in a fun and interactive way.

This is the solution to a problem I foresaw as more people submitted verses -- File Management. 
Between Lush and I both receiving verses with various forms of submission (dm, email, text, etc...) 
it would be unnecessarily time consuming to have to organize these ourselves.

******** FEATURES ********

This website features a single submission email (who.r.you.rlly@gmail.com) which will be the only location where submissions are reviewed,
And a one-page interactive experience where users can preview / download the instrumentals and be fully immersed by each one.
